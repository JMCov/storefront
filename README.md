# LAB - Class 36

## Project: Store Front

### Author: Jordan Covington

### Problem Domain  

Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.

Phase 2 Requirements

In phase 2, we will be adding the “Add to Cart” feature to our application, which will allow our users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.
